# Dumpsc

**Dumpsc** is a python project which helps you to decode and extract images from supercell files.

## Usage

Create **In-Compressed** directory and include the `*.sc` files in the directory.

Then simply run:
> python Main.py

## Credits

I can say I have done almot nothing in this project other than making it easy to use and good to look at.
